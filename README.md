### Agile Development Tool

I am using an agile software development tool in the development of this website.  I am using Github Projects, using a basic Kanban Template.  I addded automation so that as each issue is added , it adds it to the 'To Do' list for my project.  as I started working on each issue I move it to the 'In progress' column.  When coding was completed , the issue was then moved to the 'done' column.

## Web Marketing

Dionne's Wines is a business to customer business, where we want to reach as many customers as possible, to sell as many bottles of wine as possible.  We want to do this in a way to sttract new customers but also retain our existing customers.

### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)

Keywords for search engine optimisation: buying wine, wine delivery, wines delivered to your door, wines online Ireland, online wine delivery Ireland, wines delivered, buy wine online, buy wine, wines online.
I improved my search engine optimization by using semantic html and using strong tags to emphasize relevant words. I revisited my anchor tags and checked the text to make sure I was using keywords where appropriate.  I have included the meta tags in the head of my base.html to include my keywords.

### Content Marketing

Dionne's Wines has included meaningful content to attract new customers and retain customers, with the description of each wine. Also including other customers feedback on their buying experience with Dionne's Wines, which will hopefully evoke an emotional response to build trust and loyalty. Sharing customers reviews of the individual wines gives new and existing customers more information to help them make decisions on what to buy. Finally their are blog posts to give customers information on new wines and vineyards that the wines are from.  This shows off Dionne's Wines expertise and positions them as a reliable, trustworthy source of information.  Content marketing must work closely with SEO and social media.  Dionne's wines will have to add interesting and relevant blog posts on a regular basis to keep their customers engaged and informed.  It also needs to be organised and consistent in order to build up their reputation.

### Social Media Marketing

Social media allows you to share content that attracts relevant customers and keep in touch with how customers feel about your brand. Dionne's Wines can do this through their facbook page.  This extends their reach to new potiential customers. Dionne's Wines will have to post regularly to their facebook page with interesting articles, new wines available and special offers, to remind their followers of what they are offering, this pairs very nicely with content marketing.  As Dionne's Wines is a small growing business this will be done organically first, as this is free.  This will build Dionne's Wines identity and become recognisable to customers.  There is a risk that there could be negative feedback about Dionne's Wines, which would abviously be bad for business.

### Email marketing

Email marketing is an area that all e-commerce businesses can benefit from, costs are low and you don't need to invest much time, to gain new customers and retain existing customers.  The problem is spam, so they have to try and give the user content that is useful - like discount codes or promotions. Email markeing must be GDPR compliant, users must opt in.  Dionne's Wines have a mailchimp sign up form on the footer of their website so users can sign up.

Dionne's Wines users are online users searching for wines to be delivered to their home. Lots of my potiential customers would have social media accounts.  They may need information on wines, what wines to drink on certain occasions, what wines to drink with certain foods. This is were my blog post with interesting blogs on different wines, maybe new wines, what wines are most popular.  Also giving users themselves the opportunity to rate/review wines that they have tried that other users can read and decide whether to try.
Also users being able to rate/review the buying process from my website to build trust and encourage others to buy and if a user has a bad experience then try and fix it to improve the overall offering by my website.
The goals of my business is to sell as much wine as possible but to also encourage new customers to buy while also retaining existing customers.
As we are a small business email marketing which is relatively cheap to communicate with potiential customers to tell them about special offers and discounts, or new wines that are available.  Also have a presence on social media platforms like facebook, promoting special offers and also sharing content that is useful and of benefit to potential customers.
