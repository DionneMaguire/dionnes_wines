Email marketing is an area that all e-commerce businesses can benefit from, costs are low and you don't need to invest much time. Problem is spam, so try and give the user content that is useful - like discount codes.
email must be GDPR compliant, users must opt in

Users are online users searching for wines to be delivered to their home. Lots of my users would be on facebook, instagram, youtube and twitter. 
my customers need information on wines, what wines to drink on certain occasions, what wines to drink with certain foods. This is were my blog post with interesting blogs on different wines, maybe new wines, what wines are most popular.  Also giving users themselves the opportunity to rate/review wines that they have tried that other users can read and decide whether to try.
Also users being able to rate/review the buying process from my website to build trust and encourage others to buy and if a user has a bad experience then try and fix it to improve the overall offering by my website.
The goals of my business is to sell as much wine as possible but to also encourage new customers to buy while also retaining existing customers.
As we are a small business email marketing which is relatively cheap to communicate with potiential customers to tell them about special offers and discounts, or new wines that are available.  Also have a presence on social media platforms like facebook and instagram, promting special offers and also sharing content that is useful and of benefit to potential customers.
