During the performance, he made sourdough bread, and spoke about the connection to the ‘other world’ which he believes is always present in the Irish language. ‘Scim’, a word which means both a dusting of flour on a surface, and the thin veil between the corporal and spiritual worlds, illustrated the magic of sourdough, which, using unseen elements in the air, seems to rise of its own accord. I’m reminded of this in the cellar of Chateau de Montdomaine as Louisa Plou describes the wine which evaporates during the winemaking process as ‘The Angels Share’. The magic of natural yeast, like sourdough bread, comes from these invisible particles with the power to transform grapes into wine, bringing the history of all previous vintages with it.\r\nLouisa and Fred Plou make their wines in a centuries-old cave, hewn out of the tufa stone for which the Touraine region is famous. The cellar becomes a library of yeast, so this environment is unique to them, and their wines. The atmosphere in the cave is carefully minded, and they are slow to introduce other yeasts which might upset the balance. Fred has in the past made a tank of Gamay, not to make into wine, but to strengthen the good yeast in the air against bad bacteria which could take over. On this point, Louisa says they are practical, not hard-core. They sometimes need to add selected yeast to the red wine if the fermentation is too slow, and Fred ruefully accepts that if you have too high an opinion, you sometimes have to climb down - ‘mettre de l’eau dans le vin’. Having a restaurant has also given them another perspective as wine buyers. While they make their wine in a natural way, the wine must be good. They have heard the excuse for wine where the bad bacteria have overpowered the good that ‘it’s natural wine, you just don’t understand it’. They do. If the wine doesn’t taste good, the customer won’t buy it again.\r\nTheir restaurant, Chez Bruno in Amboise, named after Fred’s late father, and on the site of the pub where Louisa, visiting from England, met her future husband, is a joyful place, buzzing with conviviality, and a great place to enjoy the Montdomaine wines with excellent local food. When Fred’s father died, he worked with his uncle in the family vineyard, but it soon became clear that they had different views. Fred wanted to work in a natural way, more interested in quality than quantity. With a family winemaking tradition going back 500 years, Fred and Louisa began their own domaine in 2015, buying Chateau de Montdomaine, and 15 hectares of land which had belonged to Fred’s father. In the cave, Fred talks about the oenologist approach to winemaking, which advocates a higher temperature to extract certain aromas and flavours. He disagrees. Having this ancient cave with it’s naturally low temperature allows him to ferment at lower temperatures and he has no problem with the fermentation taking longer. This gives a true expression of their terroir, and the ambient temperature, whether warmer or cooler, is the expression of the vintage. This is not something they want to manipulate, but work carefully and meticulously to ensure a good bacterial load in the cave.\r\nAs vignerons, they are at the mercy of nature, and Fred and Louisa have introduced other elements to their business, such as the wonderful Chez Bruno restaurant, a wine shop in Amboise, and vineyard visits which can include lunch or a specially packed picnic to enjoy in their beautiful garden. While a springtime visit ‘á vélo’ is in my sights, for now, I’ll pour myself a glass and breathe in the unique atmosphere of Montdomaine at my own kitchen table."}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Jousset report - Live from Loire!", "slug": "jousset-report-live-from-loire", "image": "blog2.webp", "image_url": null, "date_created": "2022-11-14T15:50:10.716Z", "content": "A small contingent of Wines Direct ragamuffins gallivanted off to the Loire Valley to catch up with some of our winemakers in the area. One stop at the King of Pet Nat's cellar left our team flabbergasted. In all the right ways. Here's how they got on!\r\nIf the visit with Lise and Bertrand Jousset were live telly rather than written, the beep machine would be hard at it! They are vociferous and unambiguous about the issues they have with the regulation-bound world of French wine, leading to their decision to leave the A.O.C altogether this year. \"F- you, you won't have our money any more!\". Lise has had enough of paying to be part of the Montlouis sur Loire appellation every year, only to be told that their wines are not typical of the style, therefore can't be called Montlouis. She's mad as hell! The massive corporations who get twice the yield per hectare as they do, who manipulate their wine to fit the required taste profile, and who have time to go to the Appellation Controllée meetings as they don't work in their vineyards, call the shots. So, they've had enough. They would prefer to give their money to their staff than to the A.O.C. so their wines will now all be labelled 'Vin de France'.\r\n20 years ago, according to Bertrand, France wasn't ready for 'Vin de France', as in, Vin de France which was excellent, quirky, and naturally made, not cheap, generic table wine. Now, the big cities like New York, Paris and London have embraced this wine revolution, as have many wine bars and restaurants around Ireland. Walking around the cellar with Bertrand Jousset is head-melting. He talks at 100 miles an hour and they have multiple things going on, all of which are particular to their own style of wine, or a new idea which Lise wants to try. While naturally fermented Pet-Nat is one of their signature wines, they are endlessly curious. Solera style 'Rancio' which makes a sherry style wine is aging in a little pot-bellied glass tank. Up a ladder which I was too scared to climb, another small tank of Chenin Blanc was slowly morphing into a Madeira-like wine, using late-harvested grapes. The harvest this year was fantastic both in terms of quantity and quality -'historic' according to Lise- so every corner of the cellar and yard has something on the go. Fermentation is generally in barrels, some new, most old. This can take up to a year as they use only natural yeast. The barrel fermentation is not for\r\nflavour, but because they want to ferment slowly in smaller containers. After fermentation, the wine matures for a year, maybe two, in tanks. How long is up to the Joussets. At the moment, all the wine we tasted from the tank has no added SO2, but Bertrand will see if a small amount is needed. He doesn't follow a dogma about 'no added sulphites', if he needs to add some, he will. He is known by lovers of their wine as 'The King of Pet-Nat'. He isn't a fan of the term 'natural wine' as he feels it has been hijacked, and prefers 'Vin Libre' - wine which is free from restrictions.\r\nBack in the day, when Bertrand and Lise wanted to make Pet-Nat using only natural yeast, people thought they were mad. They now have a loyal and ever-growing following, but nothing they do is to please the market or follow any trend. They are very proud of their terroir in Montlouis sur Loire and the reason they refuse to manipulate their wine to fit the AOC guidelines is because they want to respect their Domaine and its particular characteristics. Lise has spoken to like-minded producers in the area about forming an alternative association of vine growers and winemakers who farm and make wine with this same respect, but says it's still too much of a jump for people to lose the comfort blanket, and indeed tradition, of the Appellation. They have jumped, and I feel sure they will soon have a very interesting wine troupe jumping after them."}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "Dingle Food Festival September '22", "slug": "dingle-food-festival-september-22", "image": "dingle_blog.webp", "image_url": null, "date_created": "2022-11-14T15:52:17.993Z", "content": "There was a heightened air of excitement in Dingle this year. The two year hiatus has produced an energy and feeling of gratitude which was palpable in everyone you met. Mind you, Dingle Food Festival always has its own unique energy, in part because its Dingle, and also because its a coming together of Irish food, drink and hospitality people to celebrate what we do.  One of the things I love about this food festival is that it's all about small, independent producers, there's no big corporate sponsorship.\r\nAll the restaurants, bars and food outlets in town set out their stall, and offer a taster of their specialities, be it oysters and Bloody Marys at Fentons, raclette at The Little Cheese Shop, or any number of tasty morsels picked up streetside. Of course, a fine drop of wine is also essential to add to the experience, that's what we're there for. We were so happy to set up in the beautiful, calm space which is Carol Cronins art gallery. Her immersive seascapes, some from an underwater perspective, draw you in and give a deep feeling of peace. What better environment to enjoy the wines of Jo Landron, imbued with the salty tang of the Atlantic.\r\nAnother joy of Dingle Food Festival is bumping into chefs, food and drink producers and fellow workers in the Irish hospitality scene, and it can take quite a while to walk through town. The girls from Valentia Island Vermouth came to our wine and tapas night at Random restaurant, and we enjoyed an exclusive Vermouth tasting as well as plenty of laughs. Micheál Begley gave us free reign in his restaurant for the night, and craic was had along with great wines and a cheese and salami selection from Mark Murphy of The Little Cheese Shop. There was more wine and cheese on Sunday afternoon when Mark and I did a tasting at the Courthouse Pub for a lively and inquisitive crowd. All weekend there's music in the streets and the pubs, cookery demos in St. James' Church, and the Blas na h-Eireann awards which bring hundreds of small producers to town.\r\nDingle is a special place. It's remoteness gives it an other-worldliness and independence, and the people who live here have a fierce love for the place, be they born and bred locals, or those who have chosen to live here and are very pleased with their decision. Did I mention the pubs? Dingle pubs are surely deserving of Unesco World Heritage status, so if you need one more reason to come, there you have it...an embarrassment of reasons!"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Agriturismo - Holiday on an Italian Vineyard!", "slug": "agriturismo-holiday-on-an-italian-vineyard", "image": "blog4.webp", "image_url": null, "date_created": "2022-11-14T15:55:32.427Z", "content": "Wine always tastes better on holidays, that’s a scientific fact*, isn’t it? When that holiday tasting is also in the middle of a vineyard the effect is multiplied exponentially. The concept of terroir- the characteristics which come from the environment in which the wine is produced- is very important in winemaking, and this extends to the food of the region. As much as the winemaker is fiercely proud of his or her wine, so too are they eager to show you their local culinary specialities which perfectly compliment their wine. No surprise that wine tourism has become an important part of the business for many producers.\r\nMy first visit to a vineyard was to Colutta in Friuli in Italy, and I stayed in Giorgio Colutta’s beautifully restored apartments above the cellar. An old barn has been converted into holiday suites and guests can swim in the outdoor pool, sipping a cool Ribolla Gialla surrounded by the vines from which it came. When we visited, Giorgio, also a fine cook, shared many local treats with us, including cheese from Fagagna, San Daniele ham, a potato and cheese pie called Frico, and wild boar which he also shot. Now, not all vineyards offer all of these experiences, and I’m not expecting Giorgio to head out hunting for every guest, but you can be sure of a very personal welcome when you visit independent wine producers like this. We visited Laura Rizzotto, of Balestri Valda in Soave, earlier this year and she was completing a renovation project on an old farmhouse, which now houses holiday apartments. Looking over her rolling vineyards, an infinity pool flowing out into the hills, this is a little patch of heaven. Laura farms organically and is a beekeeper, very committed to biodiversity, so along with vines, they are also surrounded by olive, apple, pomegranate and pear trees. And bees, Laura and her husband Federico’s real obsession. Her aim in moving into agriturismo is to show guests the importance of biodiversity, how important the bees are to our survival, and that it is possible to be sustainable while also being beautiful and luxurious. Her wonderful Soave wine, olive oil and honey are also on hand, along with local organic produce, to nurture body and soul.\r\nMy husband likes to drink wine, but he isn’t interested in spending hours slurping and spitting, definitely not the spitting! The great advantage of wine tourism, or agriturismo, as any farm tourism is called in Italy, is that there is plenty to do, or not do, for the non-wine-nut. That pool, for starters, then a stroll or cycle to the town of Soave for some lunchtime pasta. This is hilly country, so Laura sensibly has e-bikes available for guests. About an hour from Soave is the beautiful vineyard of Tiziano Accordini and family, who have also ventured into the world of agriturismo. If you want to move from white wines to red, this is the spot. From the juicy lunchtime Valpollicella to the rich and powerful Amarone for dinner, you can relax by the pool looking over the vineyards rolling out to the horizon. Their very luxurious accommodation also comes with a high environmental ethos, being self-sufficient for energy. Their local food is celebrated at breakfast, along with their desire to share the cultural wealth which surrounds them.\r\nWhat sets these experiences apart is the direct connection with the producers who have lovingly put them together. All of these vineyard stays have about 5 rooms and are run by the family. To give a glimpse into the life of a winemaker, and to share the fruits of the land, both vinous and culinary, is their aim. How deeply you want to immerse yourself in wine is your choice, after which, the pool is waiting. *yes - we're the scientists!"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "test", "slug": "test", "image": "", "image_url": null, "date_created": "2022-11-15T14:06:46.399Z", "content": "test, test test"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 9, "fields": {"title": "test9", "slug": "new-white-wines-on-the-market", "image": "mark-rob.jpg", "image_url": null, "date_created": "2022-11-15T15:07:37.500Z", "content": "edit the content"}}]
